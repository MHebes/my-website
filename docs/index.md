# Notes on net neutrality

## The current situation

Obama-era rules from 2015-2017 banned broadband providers from slowing or blocking access to the internet or charging companies higher fees for faster access.

## Timeline

### 2005

The FCC fined NC ISP Madison River for blocking phone calls on the internet

### 2008

FCC tells Comcast to stop throttling BitTorrent connections. Comcast sues the FCC and wins, saying they can slow down connections if they want to.

### 2009

The FCC pressures Apple and AT&T to stop blocking Skype calls

### Dec 21, 2010

FCC adopts "Open Internet Order" which forces ISPs to be transparent abo
ut how they handle network congestion, prohibit them from blocking traffic such as Skype on wire networks, outlaw "unreasonable" discrimination on networks. Actually differed little from 2005 rules. Didn't prohibit "paid prioritization".

### Jan 14, 2014

Verizon v. FCC decided their rules were illegal, despite many people thinking they didn't go far enough.

### Feb 26, 2015

FCC (lead by Tom Wheeler) adopts sweeping net neutrality order, where ISPs cannot block nor prioritize internet traffic
"Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet".
Classified broadband internet service as a public utility.

### 2016

June 14 - U.S. Court of Appeals holds up the Feb 2015 rules

Nov 8 - Donald Trump elected

### 2017

Jan 23 - Ajit Pai appointed FCC Chairman

March 23 - The senate removed measures set up by the FCC that kept internet usage data private from ISPs.

April 26 - Ajit Pai announces repeal proposal

May 18 - FCC votes to start rolling back net neutrality regulations

Dec 14 - FCC votes 3 to 2 in favor of reversing Title II regulations

### 2018

Feb 22 - "Restoring Internet Freedom" ruling published, where opponents could have 60 legislative days from that date to nullify it under the CRA.

May 16 - US Senate passes CRA resolution on 52-47 vote, but...

June 11 - With the US House of Representatives failing to act under the CRA, the FCC's rules took effect.

Sept 30 - California passed regulations for Net Neutrality protections. The Trump administration swiftly filed a lawsuit stating that the regulations "interfere with the federal government's approach to the Internet"

## Questions

- Why did ISPs build their infrastructure in the first place?
    - Comcast had it's streaming services and wanted to sell those
    - They built their infrastructure with the expectation that they would see a return on that investment
    - Other companies like YouTube, Netflix, etc. kind of piggybacked off of that
- DSL is an interesting example; it was originally title II (a utility provider). If a phone company built out DSL infrastructure, they had to be able to "debundle" it and allow competitors to use the wires... Interesting.
    - Is that why DSL didn't improve very much? Possibly why fiber improved much more.
    - DSL debundling requirement went away in 2005.

## Rough Draft

> The open Internet drives the American economy and serves, every day, as a critical tool for America's citizens to conduct commerce, communicate, educate, entertain, and egage in the world around them. â€” FCC 15-24

These are the words which begin the FCC's 2015 order, "In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet". Internet-savvy readers out there will recognize this kind of language as the same which was plastered on the face of websites such as Amazon, Reddit, and Netflix in mid 2017, in a "day of action" promoted by these online companies in order to preserve what they saw to be the lifeblood of the internet, and the cradle of innovation.

Since then, the landscape around net neutrality has taken quite a turn. Before we get into that, though, let us take a step back, and see how we got here -- wherever it is that might be.

Way back in 1996, DSL was state-of-the art for consumer internet. Companies like AT&T invested in copper wire infrastructure to service their customers with phone and internet connections over the same copper wires. While this meant you couldn't talk on the phone *and* use the internet at the same time in many households, it also meant that the infrastructure necessary was profitable to build for large providers like AT&T.

Also in 1996, the FCC laid out some of the first rules (since 1934) regarding ISPs and what they could and couldn't send over their own wires. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 decided that the large telephone companies' networks had to be *unbundled*. This means that competing companies, called competing local exchange carriers (CLECs) could piggyback on the work the incumbent providers (e.g. AT&T, Comcast) did in laying the cable, and provide directly competing services in local areas. The FCC's goal in this act was to encourage competition in providers -- and that goal was largely achieved. *insert stats to support that claim here*

That state of competition was maintained with shakey equillibrium between CLECs and bigger companies for a little while. As the tug-of-war of these things goes, however, in 2004 the unbundling rules which allowed many CLECs to thrive were shot down in a U.S. appeals court case, which decided that the FCC had overstepped its bounds in regulating the states and service providers.

So, in 2005, the FCC had a light-touch approach to net neutrality. They laid out some guildlines for telcom companies to follow:

> To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote theopen and interconnected nature of the public Internet,

1. "... consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice"

2. "... consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement."

3. "... consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that
do not harm the network."

4. "... consumers are entitled to competition among network providers,
application and service providers, and content providers"

These polices were entirely voluntary, since they were not a ruling nor a law.

How did they hold up?

* In 2005, the FCC fined internet service provider Madison River for flat-out blocking phone calls made over their ports. The chairman at the time, Michael Powell, said that the FCC "saw a problem and acted swiftly," by fining the ISP $15,000.

* In 2007, Comcast was found to be throttling BitTorrent connections, a peer-to-peer file transfer service that has a tendency to eat up a lot of bandwidth. Comcast in turn, noting that their networks were not designed to handle such a load, eventually sued the FCC and won. The Court decided that the FCC did not have the power nor justification to enforce rules. This case marked the first real attempt by the FCC to enforce net neutrality rules.

* AT&T forced Apple to block Skype on their phones from 2007 to 2009, and later disabled FaceTime in 2012 unless customers subscribed to a more expensive plan.

Despite these misteps, the internet continued to expand and envelop every facet of American life. Soon, a new FCC adopted the "Open Internet Order" in late December 2010. This was an attempt at compromise to enforce net neutrality by reclassifying ISPs as Title II, or public utilities. It said that ISPs must be transparent about how they handle network congestions, prohibitted them from blocking traffic (such as Skype) on wire networks, and outlawwed "unreasonable" discrimination on networks. This was widely regarded as most compromises are - with both sides being severely disappointed that the rules both completely overstepped the FCC's power, and didn't go far enough.

Those rules lasted a little over three years before a court case between Verizon and the FCC almost completely gutted them, leaving the question of the FCC's regulatory power once again in a kind of limbo.

In 2015, the FCC adopted a sweeping net neutrality order, in which ISPs cannot block nor prioritize internet traffic. When people discuss net neutrality, these rules are usually what they mean. The rules were actually held up in a U.S. Court of Appeals in 2016.

Everything shook up once again after 2015, though. Ajit Pai, the new FCC Chairman as of January 2017, announced his proposal to repeal the 2015 rules. In December of the same year, the FCC voted 3 to 2 in favor of reversing the Title II classifications. The US Senate passed resolutions to possibly block the ruling, but they failed in the House of Representatives.

The most recent development is that in Sept of 2018, California passed regulations similar to the 2015 Title II ones. The Trump Administration is currently suing the state, saying that the regulations "interfere with the federal government's approach to the Internet".

So, what's the future, and what's the best way forward? **who knows**
