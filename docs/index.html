        <h1 class="article">Untangling the Web of Net Neutrality</h1>

        <hr>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The open Internet drives the American economy and serves, every day, as a critical tool for America's citizens to conduct commerce, communicate, educate, entertain, and engage in the world around them.</p> 
            <cite>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 15-24</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>These are the words which begin the FCC's 2015 order, "In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet."</p>

        <p>Internet-savvy readers out there will recognize this kind of language as the same which was plastered on the face of websites such as Amazon, Reddit, and Netflix in mid-2017, in a "day of action" promoted by these online companies in order to preserve what they saw to be the lifeblood of the internet, and the cradle of innovation.</p>

        <p>What did that day of action achieve? Some would say nothing substantial, but the slurry of online campaigns for net neutrality at least brought the issue to the public's attention, possibly to the point of over-exposure.</p>

        <p>Even with the support of these online communities, net neutrality rules seem to be on the back foot for the time being. Ajit Pai repealed Title II rules, and the Trump Administration is suing the State of California for enacting their own regulations in response.</p>

        <p>Why is this issue contentious in the first place? To some, it may appear irrational (or intentionally dishonest) to be against such a clearly good thing. This is a complex issue with a century of history behind it, and I hope to illuminate some of that here.</p>

        <p>First, though, we should get our definitions straight.</p>

        <h2>ISPs, Packets, and the FCC</h2>

        <p>Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, etc. are all Internet Service Providers, or ISPs. Once upon a time, though, they (or the companies they grew from) were mostly telephone or cable companies.</p>
        <p>In the late 80s, they started to get into the business of commercial internet operations by providing dial-up service. This was slow but had one key advantage: it used the same phone lines that the companies had already built, and so was quite cost-effective.</p>

        <p>What do ISPs do? At their simplest, they rent space (bandwidth) on those wires that they've spent billions burying underground or stringing from telephone poles.</p>

        <p>When you open a link to a webpage, your computer must download it from a server (which is probably a computer owned by Amazon somewhere). You download it in discrete chunks called "packets", which also contain information about where they're coming from, and where they're going.</p>

        <p>Usually, that information is only used to send the packet in the right direction. Between the server and yourself, the packets are going to make a few stops at intermediary computers in the middle. Some of those intermediaries are owned by your ISP.</p>

        <p>Net Neutrality is simply that idea: that it doesn't matter where the packets are coming from, or where they are headed. The ISP will send them on their merry way all the same.</p>

        <p>The FCC's policies on enforcing this idea has varied wildly, and ISPs have long fought for the right to control where data from certain sources goes and doesn't go, and how quickly it can get there. If an ISP were able to discriminate between kinds of data, for instance, they could create a tiered payment program, where the lower tiers only allow access to certain approved websites.</p>

        <p>Now, let us take a step back, and see how we got here.</p>

        <h2>The History of Net Neutrality</h2>

                    <p>FCC established with the Communications Act of 1934 to regulate telephone, telegraph, and radio communications. This act and its amendments "regulate virtually all aspects of the communications and broadcasting industry" (U.S. Office of Justice Programs).</p>

                    <p>"Digital subscriber line" (DSL) technology is state-of-the art for consumer internet. Companies like AT&amp;T invest in copper wire infrastructure to service their customers with phone and internet connections over the same wires. This improvement over the old dial-up connections means you could talk on the phone and use the internet at the same time.</p>

                    <p>The FCC lays out some of the first rules regarding ISPs and what they could and couldn't send over their own wires. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 decided that the large telephone companies' networks had to be <em>unbundled</em>.</p>

The FCC's goal in this act was to encourage competition in providers, a goal which achieved some success, and the state of competition was maintained with shaky equilibrium between CLECs and bigger companies for a little while. </p>

                    <p>The FCC, with a light-touch approach to net neutrality, lays out some of the first guidelines for telecom companies to follow:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet,</p>
                        <p>"... consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice"</p>
                        <p>"... consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement."</p>
                        <p>"... consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that
                            do not harm the network."
                        </p>
                        <p>"... consumers are entitled to competition among network providers,
                            application and service providers, and content providers"

The Court decided that the FCC did not have the power nor justification to enforce rules. This case marked the first real attempt by the FCC to enforce net neutrality rules.</p>

                    <p>A new FCC adopted the "Open Internet Order" in late December. This was an attempt at compromise to enforce net neutrality by reclassifying ISPs as Title II, or public utilities. It said that ISPs must be transparent about how they handle network congestions, prohibited them from blocking traffic (such as Skype) on wire networks, and outlawed "unreasonable" discrimination on networks. This was widely regarded poorly, with both sides being severely disappointed that the rules either completely overstepped the FCC's power, or didn't go far enough.</p>

        <h2>The Debate</h2>

        <p>If you listen to the FCC in 2015, then net neutrality is the driver of the American economy. If you listen to the FCC in 2017 up to now, then net neutrality stifles innovation. How can both things be said with equal amounts of confidence? It may be that it depends on your perspective.</p>

        <p>The United States currently has decent-but-not-great infrastructure for its internet, globally speaking. Our upload and downloads speeds are ranked 20th in the world (First place is Singapore, with over twice our speeds). If you go by bandwidth-per-user, we drop down to 43rd place.</p>
        <p>In 2010, the FCC responded to a congressional mandate to improve the situation with a “National Broadband Plan” that outlined ways the government could do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Design policies to ensure robust competition and, as a result maximize consumer welfare, innovation and investment.</li>
            <li>Ensure efficient allocation and management of assets government controls or influences, such as spectrum, poles, and rights-of-way, to encourage network upgrades and competitive entry.</li>
            <li>Reform current universal service mechanisms to support deployment of broadband and voice in high-cost areas; and ensure that low-income Americans can afford broadband; and in addition, support efforts to boost adoption and utilization.</li>
            <li>Reform laws, policies, standards and incentives to maximize the benefits of broadband in sectors government influences significantly, such as public education, health care and government operations.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some of these bullet points seem vague, and in some sense, they have to be. When the FCC throws the word "innovation" around, it's unclear exactly what innovation it's talking about.</p>

        <p>It is true that an open internet allows for online business in a way that has never been possible before. Whole industries have cropped up utilizing this concept; streaming services alone have made millions off the wires and fiber laid by ISPs. However, it is also true that the companies who laid those wires in the first place did so with an expectation of a return-on-investment.</p>

        <p>Is it necessarily fair that Netflix devours 15-20% of <em>all</em> internet bandwidth, and is growing, yet does not contribute to the cost of infrastructure maintenance and expansion?</p>

        <p>Should an ISP front the cost of installing more fiber in a neighborhood where a single BitTorrent user is filling the pipes to the point where their neighbors' connections slow to a crawl?</p>

        <p>The open internet is probably a good thing, overall, but that idealism might be tempered if what you desire is an internet on par with the best in the world in terms of coverage and speed.</p>
