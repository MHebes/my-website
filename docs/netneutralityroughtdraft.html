  <blockquote>
   <p>The open Internet drives the American economy and serves, every day, as a critical tool for America's citizens to conduct commerce, communicate, educate, entertain, and egage in the world around them. — Federal Communications Commision (FCC) 15-24</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the words which begin the FCC's 2015 order, "In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet." Internet-savvy readers out there will recognize this kind of language as the same which was plastered on the face of websites such as Amazon, Reddit, and Netflix in mid 2017, in a "day of action" promoted by these online companies in order to preserve what they saw to be the lifeblood of the internet, and the cradle of innovation.</p>
<p><em>need a hook or something</em></p>
<p>Since then, the landscape around net neutrality has taken quite a turn. Before we get into that, though, let us take a step back, and see how we got here -- wherever it is that might be.</p>
<p>Way back in 1996, a technology called "digital subscriber line" (DSL) was state-of-the art for consumer internet. Companies like AT&amp;T invested in copper wire infrastructure to service their customers with phone and internet connections over the same copper wires. While this meant you couldn't talk on the phone <em>and</em> use the internet at the same time in many households, it also meant that the infrastructure necessary was profitable to build for large providers like AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Also in 1996, the FCC laid out some of the first rules (since 1934) regarding ISPs and what they could and couldn't send over their own wires. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 decided that the large telephone companies' networks had to be <em>unbundled</em>. This means that competing companies, called competing local exchange carriers (CLECs) could piggyback on the work the incumbent providers (e.g. AT&amp;T, Comcast) did in laying the cable, and provide directly competing services in local areas. The FCC's goal in this act was to encourage competition in providers -- and that goal was largely achieved. <em>insert stats to support that claim here</em></p>
<p>That state of competition was maintained with shakey equillibrium between CLECs and bigger companies for a little while. As the tug-of-war of these things goes, however, in 2004 the unbundling rules which allowed many CLECs to thrive were shot down in a U.S. appeals court case, which decided that the FCC had overstepped its bounds in regulating the states and service providers.</p>
<p>So, in 2005, the FCC had a light-touch approach to net neutrality. They laid out some guildlines for telcom companies to follow:</p>
<blockquote>
   <p>To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote theopen and interconnected nature of the public Internet,</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
   <li>
    <p>"... consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice"</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>"... consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement."</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>"... consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that
     do not harm the network."
 </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>"... consumers are entitled to competition among network providers,
     application and service providers, and content providers"
 </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These polices were entirely voluntary, since they were not a ruling nor a law.</p>
<p>How did they hold up?</p>
<ul>
   <li>
    <p>In 2005, the FCC fined internet service provider Madison River for flat-out blocking phone calls made over their ports. The chairman at the time, Michael Powell, said that the FCC "saw a problem and acted swiftly," by fining the ISP $15,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>In 2007, Comcast was found to be throttling BitTorrent connections, a peer-to-peer file transfer service that has a tendency to eat up a lot of bandwidth. Comcast in turn, noting that their networks were not designed to handle such a load, eventually sued the FCC and won. The Court decided that the FCC did not have the power nor justification to enforce rules. This case marked the first real attempt by the FCC to enforce net neutrality rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype on their phones from 2007 to 2009, and later disabled FaceTime in 2012 unless customers subscribed to a more expensive plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these misteps, the internet continued to expand and envelop every facet of American life. Soon, a new FCC adopted the "Open Internet Order" in late December 2010. This was an attempt at compromise to enforce net neutrality by reclassifying ISPs as Title II, or public utilities. It said that ISPs must be transparent about how they handle network congestions, prohibitted them from blocking traffic (such as Skype) on wire networks, and outlawwed "unreasonable" discrimination on networks. This was widely regarded as most compromises are - with both sides being severely disappointed that the rules both completely overstepped the FCC's power, and didn't go far enough.</p>
<p>Those rules lasted a little over three years before a court case between Verizon and the FCC almost completely gutted them, leaving the question of the FCC's regulatory power once again in a kind of limbo.</p>
<p>In 2015, the FCC adopted a sweeping net neutrality order, in which ISPs cannot block nor prioritize internet traffic. When people discuss net neutrality, these rules are usually what they mean. The rules were actually held up in a U.S. Court of Appeals in 2016.</p>
<p>Everything shook up once again after 2015, though. Ajit Pai, the new FCC Chairman as of January 2017, announced his proposal to repeal the 2015 rules. In December of the same year, the FCC voted 3 to 2 in favor of reversing the Title II classifications. The US Senate passed resolutions to possibly block the ruling, but they failed in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The most recent development is that in Sept of 2018, California passed regulations similar to the 2015 Title II ones. The Trump Administration is currently suing the state, saying that the regulations "interfere with the federal government's approach to the Internet".</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-good-idea">Is this a good idea?</h2>
<p>Yes. Probably. But not for certain.</p>
<p>The United States currently has decent-but-not-great infrastructure for its internet, globally speaking. Our upload and downloads speeds are ranked 20th in the world (First place is Singapore, with over twice our speeds). If you go by bandwidth-per-user, we drop down to 43rd place.</p>
<p>In 2010, the FCC responded to a congressional mandate to improve the situation with a “National Broadband Plan” that outlined ways the government could do the following:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Design policies to ensure robust competition and, as a result maximize consumer welfare, innovation and investment.</li>
   <li>Ensure efficient allocation and management of assets government controls or influences, such as spectrum, poles, and rights-of-way, to encourage network upgrades and competitive entry.</li>
   <li>Reform current universal service mechanisms to support deployment of broadband and voice in high-cost areas; and ensure that low-income Americans can afford broadband; and in addition, support efforts to boost adoption and utilization.</li>
   <li>Reform laws, policies, standards and incentives to maximize the benefits of broadband in sectors government influences significantly, such as public education, health care and government operations.</li>
</ol>
